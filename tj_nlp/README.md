This package is all in one text preprocessing pipeline and takes text input in the form of pandas series and outputs as pandas series object.

**All the text_processing sub-functions may be viewed here**
https://github.com/tariqjamil-bwp/pypi_projects/tree/main/tj_nlp


**Installing:**
pip install tj_preproc

**Usage:** (by example)
* from tj_text.tj_preproc import text_preprocessing_ds, text_preprocessing
* df2 = df1.copy()
* df2['input_data'] = text_preprocessing_ds(df2['Phrase'])

*Note:* It will not work with .apply(text_....) method, as .apply is item by item processing which may not be optimized at dataframe level.


**Details**:

**text_preprocessing_ds(pdSeries)**
It has a variety of input flags, controlling the appropritae text preprocessing activity, and are by default set to True.
The details of flags is as under:

** The function is optimized to take advantage of the multi threaded processors **

**Arguments:**
1. *pdSeries*: A positional argument, of pandas series object type, and should contain text phrases to be preprocessed

    
** All following arguments are key-word type ** 

 2. *NewLine removal*:
    Parameter: 'newlines_tabs'
    This setting when enablesd causes the function to remove all the occurrences of newlines, tabs, and combinations like: \\n, \\.

**The unoptimized function also made part of the package for comparison purposes **text_preprocessing(text)**
It accepts text string as parameter and therefore requires .apply method to operate or looping if needs selective preprocessing.
It accepts same other (2-13) parameters as above.
